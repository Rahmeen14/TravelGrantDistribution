Heyaa!
So this is my first time coding in Python and my first time implementing Genetic Algorithms!
Here's a record of all I learned from my mistakes.

1. Deep copy in Python while handling trackWiseConf list of lists
2. __future__, while performing division on floating points
3. Realised how sameness in data gives ridiculous results, need to make it more diversified
