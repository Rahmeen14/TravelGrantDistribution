# TravelGrantDistribution
### Genetic Algorithms to optimally distribute a crowdfunded amount to students as scholarships to attend technical conferences

The project implements genetic alogoritms to solve the optimisation problem of distributing traval grants to applicants based on their merit value, economic background and interests.
The scholarships awarded are constrained by the amount of money at disposal.

## Objective
- Maximise the number of individual scholarships awarded.
- Maximise the no. of scholars that are more meritorious.
- Minimise the no. of scholars that are economically strong, i.e, that can otherwise afford.
- Maximise the no. of scholarships to more prestigious conferences

## Constraints
- Total scholarship amount must be less than crowdfunded amount and must be as close to it as possible
- Applicant must be awarded scholarship to only those conferences whose subjects are of interest to them
